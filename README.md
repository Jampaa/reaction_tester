# Reaction Tester
One of my first projects — a basic yet effective reaction tester — is simple to build but helps in understanding major concepts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I’m just a 3rd-year student doing things that even a kindergartener could probably do — but hey, that’s where I’m at, and I’m doing it anyway.
